					<h1>Project Information</h1>
					<p>in-depth description</p>
					<h2>Aquatic planet prototype</h2>

				<body>Our planet is an inspiration from the planet of Kepler 138 and titan which is a water body and we have designed a planet who’s surface mainly consists of water bodies. our planet earth has land on it and can be habitable for the organisms living currently on earth. However </p> <p>on our plant, the deeper regions of these water bodies receive almost no sunlight so they have adapted to using chemosynthesis to respire and create food underwater. This results in the plants looking very different from the plants we see on earth. The main reason for most of the plants on our planet living at the bottom of the water bodies is because there is very scarce amount of solid land on the surface of XH201 and since most plants require solid ground to settle on and grow, they all inhabit the deepest parts of these water bodies as they have solid ground here. Some of the simple adaptations of these plants are that the stems of these plants are more durable and thicker than the plants on earth as they have to withstand the strong water pressure at the depths of these water bodies. They also may have more pores than other plants on its surface as they need to be able to consume more carbon dioxide dissolved in the water.</body>

					<h2>So this begs the question what is chemosynthesis?</h2>

					<body>Chemosynthesis is the process by which food is made by bacteria or other living things using chemicals as the energy source, typically in the absence of sunlight. Alternative Energy for Deep-Sea Ecosystems. Autotrophic plants use this way to respire and use food underwater. Chemosynthetic microbes, like bacteria and archaea, form the base of food webs at hydrothermal vents and cold seeps. Instead of photosynthesis, these organisms use chemosynthesis, the process of creating sugars (food) using energy released from chemical reactions as there is no light present in deep sea areas such as the Mariana Trench etc.
