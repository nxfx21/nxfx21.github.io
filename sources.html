          <h2>Kepler-138 and TITAN</h2>

          <p>Let’s talk through about the planet titan and Kepler 138 ( this has been taken from the nasa website)


          Kepler-138 d is a super Earth exoplanet that orbits an M-type star. Its mass is 2.1 Earths, it takes 23.1 days to complete one orbit of its star, and is 0.1288 AU from its star. Its discovery was announced in 2014.

          Kepler 138

          Planet Radius: 
          1.51 x Earth
          Planet Type: 
              Super Earth
          Discovery Method: 
              Transit 
          Planet Mass: 
          2.1 Earths
          Discovery Date: 
          2014
          Orbital Radius: 
          0.1288 AU
          Orbital Period: 
          23.1 days
          Eccentricity: 
          0.01


          Titan

            1.	Atmosphere:
            •	Titan is the only moon in the solar system with a substantial atmosphere.
            •	Its atmosphere is mostly nitrogen, like Earth’s, but with 50% higher surface pressure.
            2.	Surface Liquids:
            •	Titan is the only place besides Earth known to have rivers, lakes, and seas on its surface.
            •	These bodies of liquid are composed of hydrocarbons like methane and ethane.
            3.	Size:
            •	Titan is larger than the planet Mercury.
            •	It is the second-largest moon in the solar system, with Jupiter’s Ganymede being only 2% larger.
            4.	Hydrocarbon Lakes and Seas:
            •	Titan has clouds, rain, rivers, lakes, and seas of liquid methane and ethane.
            •	Some seas are hundreds of feet deep and miles wide.
            5.	Subsurface Ocean:
            •	Beneath Titan’s ice crust lies an ocean made of water, which could potentially harbor life.
            •	Surface liquids could also support life forms with different chemical bases.
            6.	Habitability:
            •	Titan’s nitrogen atmosphere is dense enough that humans wouldn’t need a pressure suit.
            •	However, they would need an oxygen mask and protection against extreme cold (around -290°F / -179°C).
            7.	Slow Rainfall:
            •	Titan’s gravity and dense atmosphere cause rain to fall more slowly than on Earth.
            •	Titan’s rain falls at 3.5 miles per hour (1.6 meters per second), compared to Earth’s 20 mph (9.2 m/s).
            8.	Raindrop Size:
            •	Titan’s raindrops are larger than Earth’s, reaching a maximum diameter of 0.37 inches (9.5 mm), about 50% larger than Earth rains</p>
